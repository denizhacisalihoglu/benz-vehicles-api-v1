# üöÄ Benz Vehicles API with Strapi on Heroku

Welcome to my API built with Strapi [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html) (CLI) and deployed on Heroku! This API is designed specifically for Mercedes Benz vehicles, allowing users to access a range of data and functionality related to their cars.

With this API, users can retrieve information on their vehicle's list with information such as id, color, price, and stock status.

This API is built using the Strapi framework, which makes it easy to manage content and data. It is deployed on Heroku, a cloud-based platform that provides seamless scaling and reliable performance.

Thank you for checking out my project!

Built with [heroku-cli](https://heroku.com/)
